\arguments{
\item{designmat}{The design matrix of the fixed effects.}

\item{outcome}{The response variable. Must be numeric.}

\item{group}{Character vector containing the group variable.}

\item{subjid}{Character vector containing the subjects IDs.}

\item{visit}{Character vector containing the visit variable.}

\item{same_cov}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} the model assumes the same covariance matrix for each group.
If \code{FALSE} a different covariance matrix for each group is assumed.}

\item{n_imputations}{Integer number corresponding to the draws from the posterior distribution needed.
It corresponds to the number of imputations to be done in the multiple imputation procedure.}

\item{burn_in}{Integer number corresponding to the number of initial MCMC iterations to be discarded. See details.}

\item{burn_between}{Integer number corresponding to the thinning of the chain. It is the number
of iterations that are discarded between two consecutive draws. See details.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} the chain flow of information is displayed in the console.}

\item{seed}{Integer number to set the seed for reproducibility of the MCMC draws.}
}
\value{
A named list composed by the following:
\itemize{
\item \code{samples}: a named list containing the draws for each parameter. It corresponds to the output of \code{\link[=extract_draws]{extract_draws()}}.
\item \code{fit}: a \code{stanfit} object.
}
}
\description{
\code{fit_mcmc()} fits the base imputation model using a Bayesian approach.
This is done through a MCMC method that is implemented in \code{stan}
and is run by using the function \code{\link[rstan:stanmodel-method-sampling]{rstan::sampling()}}.
The function returns the draws from the posterior distribution of the model parameters
and the \code{stanfit} object. Additionally it performs multiple diagnostics checks of the chain
and returns warnings in case of any detected issues.
}
\details{
The Bayesian model assumes a multivariate normal likelihood function and weakly-informative
priors for the model parameters: in particular, uniform priors are assumed for the regression
coefficients and inverse-Wishart priors for the covariance matrices.
The chain is initialized using the REML parameter estimates from MMRM as starting values.

The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Fit MMRM using a REML approach.
\item Prepare the input data for the MCMC fit as described in the \verb{data\{\}}
block of the Stan file. See \code{\link[=prepare_stan_data]{prepare_stan_data()}} for details.
\item Run the MCMC according the input arguments and using as starting values the REML parameter estimates
estimated at point 1.
\item Performs diagnostics checks of the MCMC. See \code{\link[=check_mcmc]{check_mcmc()}} for details.
\item Extract the draws from the model fit.
}

The chains perform \code{n_imputations} draws by keeping one every \code{burn_between} iterations. Additionally
the first \code{burn_in} iterations are discarded. The total number of iterations will
then be \code{burn_in + burn_between*n_imputations}.
The purpose of \code{burn_in} is to ensure that the samples are drawn from the stationary
distribution of the Markov Chain.
The \code{burn_between} aims to keep the draws uncorrelated each from other.
