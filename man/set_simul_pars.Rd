\title{Set simulation parameters of a study group.}
\usage{
set_simul_pars(
  mu,
  sigma,
  n,
  prob_ice1 = 0,
  or_outcome_ice1 = 1,
  prob_post_ice1_dropout = 0,
  prob_dropout = 0,
  prob_miss = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mu}{Numeric vector indicating the mean outcome trajectory assuming no ICEs. It should include the outcome at baseline.}

\item{sigma}{Covariance matrix of the outcome trajectory assuming no ICEs.}

\item{n}{Number of subjects belonging to the group.}

\item{prob_ice1}{Numeric vector that specifies for each visit the probability of experiencing ICE1 after the current visit for a patient with outcome equal to the mean at baseline.
If a single numeric is provided, then the same probability is applied to each visit.}

\item{or_outcome_ice1}{Numeric number that specifies the odds ratio of ICE1 corresponding to a +1 higher value of the outcome at the visit.}

\item{prob_post_ice1_dropout}{Numeric number that specifies the drop-out probability following ICE1.}

\item{prob_dropout}{Numeric that specifies the probability that a post-baseline visit is affected by study drop-out. In case the subject is still on treatment at the subject's (first) visit affected drop-out,
then dropout also triggers discontinuation of study drug and a corresponding ICE called "ICE2" is generated.}

\item{prob_miss}{Numeric number that specifies the probability for a given post-baseline observation to be missing. It can be used to produce
"intermittent" missing values (which are missing completely at random).}
}
\value{
A \code{simul_pars} object which is a named list containing the simulation parameters.
}
\description{
Use this function to provide input arguments for each study group needed to simulate data with \code{\link[=simulate]{simulate()}}.
\code{\link[=simulate]{simulate()}} generates data for a two-arms clinical trial with longitudinal continuous outcome and two intercurrent events (ICEs).
