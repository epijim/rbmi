\title{Compute covariance matrix for some reference-based methods (JR, CIR)}
\usage{
compute_sigma(sigma_group, sigma_ref, index_mar)
}
\arguments{
\item{sigma_group}{the covariance matrix with dimensions equal to \code{index_mar} for
the subjects original group}

\item{sigma_ref}{the covariance matrix with dimensions equal to \code{index_mar} for
the subjects reference group}

\item{index_mar}{A logical vector indicating which visits meet the MAR assumption
for the subject. I.e. this identifies the observations that after a non-MAR
intercurrent event (ICE).}
}
\description{
Adapt covariance matrix in reference-based methods. Used for Copy Increments in
Reference (CIR) and Jump To Reference (JTR) methods, to adapt the covariance matrix
to different pre-deviation and post deviation covariance structures. See Carpenter
et al. (2013)
