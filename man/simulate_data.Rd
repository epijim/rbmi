\usage{
simulate_data(pars_c, pars_t, post_ice_traj, strategies = getStrategies())
}
\arguments{
\item{pars_c}{A \code{simul_pars} object as generated by \code{\link[=set_simul_pars]{set_simul_pars()}}. It specifies the simulation parameters of the control arm.}

\item{pars_t}{A \code{simul_pars} object as generated by \code{\link[=set_simul_pars]{set_simul_pars()}}. It specifies the simulation parameters of the treatment arm.}

\item{post_ice_traj}{Character that specifies the assumption about post-ICE1 outcomes.
Must target a function included in \code{strategies}. Possible choices are: Missing At Random \code{"MAR"}, Jump to Reference \code{"JR"},
Copy Reference \code{"CR"}, Copy Increments in Reference \code{"CIR"}, Last Mean Carried Forward \code{"LMCF"}. User-defined strategies
could also be added. See \code{\link[=getStrategies]{getStrategies()}} for details.}

\item{strategies}{A named list of functions. Default equal to \code{\link[=getStrategies]{getStrategies()}}. See \code{\link[=getStrategies]{getStrategies()}} for details.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} containing the simulated data. It includes the following variables:
\itemize{
\item \code{id}: Factor variable that specifies the id of each subject.
\item \code{visit}: Factor variable that specifies the visit of each assessment. Visit \code{0} denotes the baseline visit.
\item \code{group}: Factor variable that specifies which treatment group each subject belongs to.
\item \code{out_bl}: Numeric variable that specifies the baseline outcome.
\item \code{out_noICE}: Numeric variable that specifies the longitudinal outcome assuming no ICEs.
\item \code{ind_ice1}: Binary variable that takes value \code{1} if the corresponding visit is affected by ICE1 and \code{0} otherwise.
\item \code{dropout_ice1}: Binary variable that takes value \code{1} if the corresponding visit is affected by the drop-out following ICE1 and \code{0} otherwise.
\item \code{out_ice1}: Numeric variable that specifies the longitudinal outcome including ICE1.
\item \code{dropout2}: Binary variable that takes value \code{1} if the corresponding visit is affected by the uninformative study drop-out.
\item \code{ind_ice2}: Binary variable that takes value \code{1} if the corresponding visit is affected by ICE2.
\item \code{outcome}: Numeric variable that specifies the longitudinal outcome including ICE1, ICE2 and the intermittent missing values.

\description{
Generate data for a two-arms clinical trial with longitudinal continuous outcome and two intercurrent events (ICEs).
}
\details{
The data generation works as follows:
\itemize{
\item Generate data from a multivariate normal distribution with parameters \code{pars_c$mu} and \code{pars_c$sigma}
for the control arm and parameters \code{pars_t$mu} and \code{pars_t$sigma} for the treatment arm.
\item Simulate ICE1 according to the given logistic model for the probability of ICE1. ICE1 could often represent treatment discontinuation due to study-related events.
\item Simulate drop-out following ICE1 according to \code{pars_c$prob_post_ice1_dropout} and \code{pars_t$prob_post_ice1_dropout}. This drop-out is conditional on ICE1 and is simulated completely at random.
\item Simulate an additional uninformative study drop-out with probabilities \code{pars_c$prob_dropout} and \code{pars_t$prob_dropout} at each visit.
The simulated time of drop-out is the subject's first visit which is affected by drop-out and data from this visit and all subsequent visits are consequently set to missing.
In addition, in case the subject is still on treatment at the subject's (first) visit affected drop-out,
then dropout also triggers discontinuation of study drug and a corresponding ICE called "ICE2" is generated. ICE2 could often represent treatment discontinuation
due to events not related to the study.
\item Adjust trajectories after the ICEs according to the given assumption expressed with the \code{post_ice_traj} argument.
}

The model for the probability of experiencing ICE1 is:
\code{~ 1 + I(visit == 0) + ... + I(visit == n_visits-1) + I((x-alpha))} where:
\itemize{
\item \code{n_visits} is the number of visits (including baseline).
\item \code{alpha = mu_c[1]} or \code{alpha = mu_t[1]}: \code{alpha} is the baseline outcome mean in the control arm if the subject belongs to the control arm. Otherwise it is the baseline outcome mean in the treatment arm.
The term \code{I((x-alpha))} specifies the dependency of the probability of ICE1 on the current outcome value.
The corresponding coefficient is \code{log(pars_c$or_outcome_ice1)} (or \code{log(pars_t$or_outcome_ice1)}) which represents the increase of the ICE1 probability
due to a +1 higher value of the outcome at the visit. \code{pars_c$or_outcome_ice1} and \code{pars_t$or_outcome_ice1} are the odds ratio corresponding to such increase in the outcome for the two groups.
}

Please note that the baseline outcome cannot be missing nor be affected by any ICEs.
